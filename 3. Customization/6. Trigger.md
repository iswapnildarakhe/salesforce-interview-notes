#### 1. What is a Trigger OR Whats the Purpose of writing a Trigger?
- Trigger is a piece of code that gets executed automatically when certain events occur in the Salesforce platform, such as the creation, update, or deletion of records.
- We write Trigger to achieve Business Automation through Code.
___
#### 2. What is a Trigger Event?
- Trigger events refer to the specific points in the life-cycle of a record when a trigger can be executed.
- Triggers are associated with these events and are executed automatically when the corresponding event occurs.
- There are 7 Trigger Events
	1. before insert
	2. after insert
	3. before update
	4. after update
	5. before delete
	6. after delete
	7. after undelete
**NOTE** : We don't use dml on the records that fired the Trigger.
___
#### 3. When to Use a before Trigger?
- A before Trigger is fired just before the record is about commit a Database change.
- A before Trigger is used when you want to work on the same record that triggered the Trigger OR records of the same Object on which Trigger is written.
- By using before Triggers we 
	1. Perform a Validation
	2. Prevent Duplicates or Delete Duplicates
	3. Update Fields
___
#### 4. When to Use a after Trigger?
- A after Trigger is fired just after the record has committed a Database change.
- A after Trigger is used to work on either the related records or records of some other Object.
- By using an After Trigger we
	1. Create Related Records
	2. Manipulate Related Records
	3. To Fetch System Generated Fields ex: Id of the record which triggered the Trigger.
___
#### 5. On which Object should you write the Trigger.
We write Trigger on the Object whose records will act as a firing condition for the Trigger.
Ex: Account is created then Create an Associated Contact. Here, the Account must be created or how will you Associate the AccountId hence, we write an after Trigger on Account.
___
#### 6. What are Trigger Context Variables?
- Trigger context variables in Salesforce are special variables provided by the platform that give you access to information and context about the trigger execution.
- Trigger context variables in Salesforce are like helpful tools that provide you with information about what is happening when a trigger is running.
- There are 13 Trigger Context Variables
	1. isBefore
	2. isAfter
	3. isInsert
	4. isUpdate
	5. isDelete
	6. isUndelete
	7. Trigger.new
	8. Trigger.newMap
	9. Trigger.old
	10. Trigger.oldMap
	11. isExecuting
	12. size()
	13. operationType
___
#### 7. Tell which Trigger Context Variables are available for which Event
1. before insert : Here the record is not in the Database hence, there won't be an Id or old Values for the record.
	1. Trigger.new
2. after insert : Here the record just got inserted in the Database hence, it has Id but no old values because its inserted for the 1st Time.
	1. Trigger.new
	2. Trigger.newMap
3. before update : Here the records is getting updated hence, it has Id and old values for the record.
	1. Trigger.new
	2. Trigger.newMap
	3. Trigger.old
	4. Trigger.oldMap
4. after update : Here the records has updated hence, it has Id and old values for the record.
	1. Trigger.new
	2. Trgger.newMap
	3. Trigger.old
	4. Trigger.oldMap
5. before delete : Here we are deleting a record hence, it has Id and old values but we are not making any changes to the values of the record we are simply deleting the record hence, there no new value.
	1. Trigger.old
	2. Trigger.oldMap
6. after delete : Here we have just deleted the record hence, it has Id and old values but we are not making any changes to the values of the record we simply deleted the record hence, there no new value.
	1. Trigger.old
	2. Trigger.oldMap
7. after undelete : Here we are undeleting the record i.e. retrieving it from the Recycle bin so, it acts as after insert hence, there is only Id and not old values. 
	1. Trigger.new
	2. Trigger.newMap

___
#### 8. Which Context Variables are Read Only?
The 2 Context Variables are Read Only and there value cannot be modified
1. Trigger.old
2. Trigger.oldMap
They cannot be modified because they are only providing the older values of the records.
____
#### 9. Why do we need Apex Trigger's while we already have other Automation Tools like Workflow Rule, Process Builder, Flow Builder?
- The other Automation Tools are part of Configuration and hence each of them has some limitations but Apex Trigger has no such limitation. Only limitation is coding skills and Salesforce governor limits i.e. triggers give you endless possibility in Automating your tasks.
- Triggers can be used to communicate with third party systems when data changes in Salesforce.
- Triggers are faster than other Automation Tools.
___
#### 10. What is a Recursive Trigger and how to Prevent it?
write for which operation this happens ex: update dml in after update will cause this
___
#### 11. What is the Order of Execution for Trigger?
___
