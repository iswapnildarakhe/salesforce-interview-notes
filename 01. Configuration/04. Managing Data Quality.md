**NOTE:** In Salesforce we ensure and manage data quality with the help of 
1. Validation Rules
2. Matching Rules and Duplicate Rules
____
#### 1. What is a Formula Field?
- It is a read only field which derives it value from other fields.
- It can be used to perform calculations ex: While studying Rollup Summary we did not had the Average so, we can implement the Average using the Rollup Summary.
- A formula has a Return type i.e.it can only return limited types of values. So, you can only perform calculations for which you have a return type.
	1. Checkbox : Checks box when logic evaluates to true ex: `TODAY() > CloseDate`
	2. Currency
	3. Date
	4. Date/Time
	5. Time
	6. Number
	7. Percent
	8. Text
Ex:
```
/* If Last Name is Blank Checkbox must be Checked */
ISBLANK( Last_Name__c )
```
____
#### 2. How can you achieve Average function from admin?
- We can achieve Average function by
	1. Creating 2 Rollup Summary Fields i.e. Sum and Count then
	2. Sum / Count = Average will be our Formula Field.
____
#### 3. What is Cross Formula Field?
- Its just the implementation of the Formula field in such way that it shows the Parents fields on the Child object.
- Only Parents fields can be shown on the Child Record and not vice versa because the Parent can have multiple children.
- This can be done in both MDR and Lookup.
- **Process** : Setup &rarr; Object Manager &rarr; Select Child Object &rarr; Fields and Relationships &rarr; New &rarr; Select Formula as Field Type &rarr; Return type depending on which field of Parent you are refering &rarr; Insert Field.
- You can use the SOQL syntax to access Parent Fields in Formula Field.
```apex
// This is how you access a standard objects field
 Account.Id
 Account.SLA__c 
// This is how you access a custom objects field
 Object_A__r.Id 
```
___
#### 4. What is a Validation Rule?
- It is a functionality that uses the Formula Functions to ensures that the data entered in the record for a field meets a certian criteria.
- A Validation Rule returns a Boolean value. And that would decide if the value entered will be saved or not
	- **error** : if validation rule returns `true`
	- **save** : if validation rule returns `false`
- **Process** : Setup &rarr; Object Manager &rarr Select an Object &rarr; Validation Rules &rarr; New
- Ex: 
```apex
/* Record should not be saved if last name is blank */
ISBLANK( Last_Name__c )
/* Now when user tries to save the record without entering the last name then the validation rule will evaluate to true and hence give and error */
```
____
#### 5. Give example of few Formula Functions.
1. ISBLANK : Checks if a Field is Blank.
2. TEXT : converts a number, date, or other value into a text string.
3. TODAY : returns the current date.
4. NOW : returns the current date and time.
5. ISPICKVAL : checks whether a picklist field's value matches a specified value. It returns true if the values match and false if they don't.

#### 6. How do you stop the user from entering Duplicate Data?
- You can achieve it by
	1. Using Matching Rules and Duplicate Rules
	2. By Apex Trigger
----
#### 7. Why do we need to stop data duplication?
- Duplicate data wastes the Physical Resources of the team i.e. different members accidentally work on same record as they were duplicates.
- It also wastes system resources ex: storage space.
- On top of that if you have lot of duplicate data it will eventually affect you business Analytics ex: A report will not be accurate as it has duplicates in it.
____
#### 8. What are Matching and Duplicate Rules?
- Matching and Duplicate rules is Salesforce's mechanism to track and prevent duplicates.
1. Matching Rule:
	- Matching rule determines whether a record created/ update by the user is duplicate or not.
	- There are Standard Matching rules for Accounts, Leads and Contacts Object.
	- You can create Custom Matching rules for Accounts, Leads and Contacts only and for all Custom Objects.
	- **Process** : Setup &rarr; Matching Rules &rarr; New &rarr; Select Object &rarr;  Select Matching Criteria &rarr; Activate.
	- Ex: Matching Criteria:
		- Field = Candidate Name 
		- Matching Method = Exact
		- Match Blank Field = false (True means if the field is blank on 2 records they are duplicates).
	- You can use Filter Logic for multiple Fields (Logic A AND Logic B)
2. Duplicate Rules
	- Duplicate rules define what actions to be carried out whenever a matching rule found match.
	- **Process** : Setup &rarr; Duplicate Rules &rarr; New Rule &rarr; Select Object &rarr; Record Level-Security (Enforce or Bypass) &rarr; Actions (On Create or On Update) &rarr; Select which Matching Rule to use &rarr; Activate.
	- So, a Matching rule must be created and it must be Active before Creating and Activating a Duplicate Rule.
	- NOTE: In the Duplicate Rule you can select with which objects field should we match so, if the Fields in the Matching Rule are also present on some other object then Object A records can be checked for Duplicates on Object B.
	- Record Level-Security :
		 1. Enforce : Only flag records as duplicate if the user who is creating/ updating has read access for the other records.
		 2. Bypass : Flag duplicates for the entire object.
	- Actions : 
		1. We determine if we want to Allow the user to create/ update a Duplicate Record.
		2. Whether to Alert the User while creating/ updating a Duplicate Record.
		3. Whether to include the Duplicates in Report or not.
