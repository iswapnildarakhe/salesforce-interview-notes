#### 1. What is Cloud Technology?

_____

#### 2. What are the models of cloud?

- Mainly there are 3 Models of Cloud.
  1. Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS) : You get the Cloud Servers, Storage and Networking from Service Provider. You need to take care of underlying infrastructure (Software side) i.e. Operating System, Database, Security Functions, etc. 
  2. Platform as a Service (PAS) : It offers a complete development and deployment framework, including the operating system, programming languages, databases, and other tools. PaaS allows developers to focus on application development rather than worrying about infrastructure management.
  3. Software as a Service (SAS) : SaaS is a model where software applications are delivered over the internet on a subscription basis. With SaaS, you don't have to install or manage the software locally on your device. Instead, you access and use the application through a web browser.

#### 9. What are the Phases involved in implementing and using the Salesforce platform?

1. Planning and Strategy: This phase involves understanding the business requirements, defining goals and objectives, and creating a roadmap for implementing Salesforce. It includes activities such as conducting a needs assessment, defining success criteria, and identifying key stakeholders.
2. Analysis and Design: In this phase, the business processes and requirements are analyzed in detail. Salesforce consultants or administrators work closely with stakeholders to gather requirements, map out processes, and design the Salesforce solution accordingly. This phase includes activities like data modeling, configuration, and customization.
3. Development and Configuration: In this phase, Salesforce is configured and customized to meet the specific needs of the organization. This may involve creating custom fields, objects, workflows, validation rules, and reports. It also includes integrating Salesforce with other systems if required.
4. Testing and Quality Assurance: Once the configuration and customization are complete, the solution undergoes rigorous testing to ensure it functions as expected. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) to validate the system against the defined requirements and scenarios.
5. Deployment and Training: Once the solution has passed testing and quality assurance, it is deployed to the production environment. This involves migrating data, setting up user access, and finalizing the system for use. Additionally, user training is conducted to ensure that users understand how to effectively use Salesforce for their roles and responsibilities.
6. Adoption and Optimization: After the initial deployment, the focus shifts to driving user adoption and continuously optimizing the Salesforce solution. This includes monitoring system usage, gathering feedback, addressing user concerns, and making enhancements based on evolving business needs.
7. Ongoing Support and Maintenance: Salesforce requires ongoing support and maintenance to ensure its smooth operation. This involves addressing user queries, troubleshooting issues, applying updates and patches, and managing security and data integrity.

Salesforce is a Multitenant Platform.

- **Salesforce Platform: Salesforce Platform is the foundation of all Salesforce Services**. It’s powered by metadata and made up of different parts, like data services, artificial intelligence, and APIs for development.  
- All Salesforce apps sit on top of the platform. Salesforce pre-built offerings like Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud, along with apps you build using the platform sit on top of the Salesforce Platform. Everything is integrated.  
- **Metadata:** is data about data. When we say data about data, we’re really talking about the structure of your Salesforce org. All standard and custom configurations, functionality, and code in your org are metadata.

#### 22. What is API?

- The application programming interface (API) allows different pieces of software to connect to each other and exchange information.  
- When you add a custom object or field, the platform automatically creates an API name that serves as an access point between your org and the database. Salesforce uses that API name to retrieve the metadata and data you’re looking for. We can use a contact’s Name field in a bunch of places, like the Salesforce mobile app, a custom page, or even an email template. That’s all possible because of the API name. The core of the API’s power is that all of your data and metadata is API enabled.
