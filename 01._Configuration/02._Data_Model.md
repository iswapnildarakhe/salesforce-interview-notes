#### 4. How Salesforce Organizes your Data / Explain Salesforce Data Model.
Salesforce organizes your data into sObjects and records.

| sObjects                                                             | Tabs                                                       | Fields                                                                                               | Rows                                                                                               |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------- |:---------------------------------------------------------- |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sObjects is like a Database Table. We store records in the sObjects. | Tabs are used to access the sObject in the User Interface. | Fields are like Columns of a Database Table. They store values of a particular type for the Records. | Records are like Rows of a Database Table i.e. they are the individual data which is been tracked. |
**NOTE** : sObjects means Salesforce Objects ex: Accounts, Contacts.

**NOTE** : 
1. An Owner is a User who has the Current Ownership of the record.
