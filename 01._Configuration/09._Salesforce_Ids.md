#### 1. 15 Digit vs 18 Digit Id.
- 15 Digit Id is case sensitive. Its provided by the Salesforce Classic UI.
- 18 Digit Id is case insensitive. Salesforce Lightning UI provides 18 Digit Id.
- Both the 15 and 18 Digit will point to the same record.
- We have the 18 Digit Id because some software's tend to mess the case of characters hence, 15 Digit won't be useful in such areas.
- For ex: While using in API's or export we use 18 Digit Ids.

#### 2. What is an External Id?
- When we are performing an Upsert or Update Operation using any Import tool and the data is from some 3rd party source in that case we won't be having any Salesforce Id. So, instead we make some field of our Object as an External Id.
- **Process** : Setup &rarr; Object Manager &rarr; Select Object &rarr; check External Id.
- You can make maximum 7 Fields as External Id.
- While making a Field External Id it would make sense to mark the field Required and Unique also because we will be using this field as an Id replacement.
- Only The following fields can be marked as External Id.
	1. Text
	2. Phone
	3. Email
	4. Number
	5. URL
