# In the Coding Drills Section I have created exercises that should be done daily so that the working methodology sink into your behavior 

# You may see some mistakes for ex: sort mySet in the Coding Drills. I have intentionally added such task in the exercise so that you should be alert that whats possible and whats not possible.

# The Drills should be performed in a Text Editor instead of directly in the force.com IDE so, that you will learn to write code with brain and just relying on the compiler to throw error whenever you mess up.
