1. What are Exceptions in Apex?
2. What are the Different Types of Exceptions?
3. When should you use Exception Handling
	1. for Async
	2. for dml
	3. for database class

Exceptions are Runtime Errors that halt your code i.e. stops the execution of your code.
Ex: You forgot to populate a field which was required for `insert` operation.
So, if you Handel the Exception what happens is: the rest of the code will run Obviously it won't make changes because you  forgot to populate a field which was required for `insert` operation.
NOTE:
- Code that is supposed to break must be written in `try{}` block.
- And `catch(Exception e){}` only needs to do the printing.
```apex
// I didn't populate Name which is a required field for Account Creation
public class ExceptionHandling {
    public void createAccount(){
        List<Account> accList = new List<Account>();
        try{
            Account acc = new Account(
                Name ='Exception');
            accList.add(acc);
            
            Account acc2 = new Account(
            Rating ='Hot');
            accList.add(acc2);
            
            insert accList;
        }
        catch(Exception e){
            System.debug('Exception = '+e);
        }
    }
}
```
NOTE: We write Exception Handling for
1. To test rest of the code or to check whats broken.
2. If we already assume that a certain functionality may break.

### Database Operations
- If we have a long List then some records might be missing Required Fields or they might have some issue with the Validation rules and if such thing happens and if you are using DML statements then the entire operation will be Rolled Back i.e. no records will be commited.
- Apex has a Built in Class called Database Class.
- Database Class contains methods that can perform DML operations.
- Database class methods are static and hence, called through the class name ex: `Database.insert();`
- So, basically Database class also, performs DML operations the only difference is that you can commit partial List of records using Database class while DML allowed the complete List only no partial commits.
- NOTE: In partial commit no exception will be thrown.
- The Database methods returns result objects containing success or failure information of each record.
	- for Insert and Update: `Database.SaveResult results[] = Database.insert(accList, false);`
	- for upsert : `Database.UpsertResult results[] = Database.upsert(accList, false);`
	- for delete : `Database.DeleteResult results[] = Database.delete(accList, false);`
```apex
public class UsingDatabaseClass {
    List<Account> accList = new List<Account>();
    public void populate(){
        Account acc = new Account(
            Name ='Exception');
        accList.add(acc);
        
        Account acc2 = new Account(
            Rating ='Hot');
        accList.add(acc2);
        
        Database.SaveResult[] resultList = Database.insert(accList, false);
        
        for(Database.SaveResult result : resultList){
            if(result.isSuccess()){
                System.debug('Successful ID = '+result.getId());
            }
            else{
                for(Database.Error error : result.getErrors()){
                    System.debug('Error Code = '+error.getStatusCode()+' Field = '+error.getFields()+' Message = '+error.getMessage());
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
