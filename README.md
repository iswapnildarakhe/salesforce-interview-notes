## Author's Recommendations

1. If you are new to Salesforce then you should first finish Reading the Official Salesforce Documentations. And only read my Project when you have at least finished the reading the Important Documentations of Salesforce (List of Official Documentations is attached to the Bottom of this file).
2. If you have certain Experience in Salesforce Admin/ Development then you can refer to the notes. I have tried my best to put all the Important topics into this Project.
3. All the information I have put in these notes has been tested by me and been gathered from the Official Documentation.
4. This is just Interview Preparation Notes, I will try to put my complete notes ASAP.
5. This project will be updated from time to time. Certain files are incomplete for now, as you can understand I am working on this personal project in my free time.
6. After Importing the Obsidian Project don't forget to update the Themes and other Plugins.

## FAQs
1. How to use this Project? <br/>
	Ans : 
		1. If you are just reading the Project then simply open the files in Browser itself as it will be easy for most of the people who don't want to learn Obsidian and MD just for the sake of reading my Notes.
		2. If you want to edit and your own notes then you need to see FAQ number. <br/>
	**NOTE** : If you are cloning the Repo and also adding your own notes then be aware that this Project is yet not completed and will be having additions every day so, you will be cloning this from time to time so, You should be capable of handling the new Clone and the Modifications that you made in your Older Clone of this Repo.
2. How can I set this project in my Laptop/Phone/Tablet? <br/>
   Ans : I have created this Project in an app Called [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). The app is available on all Platforms(Android, IOS, Mac, Windows, Linux). So, just install the app. Then Clone/ Download this Repo and Open the Folder in Obsidian. The Option in Obsidian to do so is **Open Folder as Vault**.
   So, whenever I make a Commit you just need to follow the above steps or just download those files that I have referenced in the Commit Message.
3. Can you share this Project? <br/>
   Ans : Yes, you can do whatever you want but a little credit would help. So, instead of sharing the files directly kindly share my GitHub Profile.
