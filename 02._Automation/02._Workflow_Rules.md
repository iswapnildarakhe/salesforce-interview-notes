#### 1. Explain Workflow Rules.
- Workflow Rules was a automation tool in Salesforce.
- Workflow Rules can be Created on both Custom and Standard sObjects.
- From Winter '23 you cannot create a new Workflow rule but you can activate, deactivate, and edit any existing workflow rules.
- A Workflow can automate 5 Business actions
	1. Tasks
	2. Email Alerts
	3. Field Updates
	4. Outbound Messages
	5. Select Existing Actions - Any of the above 4 actions that was created. ex: Task, Email Alert, Field Updates and Outbound Messages that you created from Setup &rarr; Workflow Actions
- A Workflow is only triggered when changes are made to a record.
- So, there are 3 changes or Evaluation Criteria's which are supported by Workflow
	1. Created
	2. Created, and every time it’s edited
	3. Created, and any time it’s edited to subsequently meet criteria
- When the Evaluation Criteria's and the Rule Criteria are meet then the Workflow actions run. Workflow actions are of 2 types and they both support the 4 Business Actions mentioned above.
	1. Immediate Workflow Actions
	2. Time-Dependent Workflow Actions
**NOTE** : You need to activate the Workflow rule after its created.
____
#### 2. Explain Difference between Created, and every time it’s edited vs Created, and any time it’s edited to subsequently meet criteria.

| Created, and every time it’s edited                                                                              | Created, and any time it’s edited to subsequently meet criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Evaluate the rule criteria each time a record is created or updated i.e. no matter which filed you are updating. | Evaluate the rule criteria each time a record is created or updated.<br/><br/>For a new record, run the rule if the rule criteria is met.<br/>For an updated record, run the rule only if the record is changed from not meeting the rule criteria to meeting the rule criteria i.e. here you need to update the Field that's referenced in the Rule Criteria. |

#### 3. Explain difference between Immediate Workflow Actions and Time-Dependent Workflow Actions.

| Immediate Workflow Actions                                                                                                                           | Time-Dependent Workflow Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Immediate actions, like their name suggests, are executed as soon as the workflow rule finishes evaluating the record and the Rule Criteria is meet. | 1. Time-dependent actions are executed at a specific time.<br/>2. When that specific time passes, the workflow rule reevaluates the record to make sure that it still meets the rule criteria. If the record does, the workflow rule executes those actions. |
____
#### 4. Tell me the process to Create a Workflow Rule
- Setup &rarr; Workflow Rules &rarr; New Rule &rarr; Select sObject &rarr; Enter Rule Name &rarr; Evaluation Criteria &rarr; Rule Criteria &rarr; Specify Workflow Actions &rarr; Activate.
 1. Available Evaluation Criteria's
	1. Created
	2. Created, and every time it’s edited
	3. Created, and any time it’s edited to subsequently meet criteria
2. Rule Criteria
	1. If criteria are met
	2. If Formula evaluates to true
3. Specify Workflow Actions
	1. Immediate Workflow Actions
	2. Time-Dependent Workflow Actions - Before you set Time-Dependent Workflow Actions you need to Add Time Trigger
___
#### 5. Explain Time Trigger.
- It specifies when the Time-Dependent Workflow Actions show run.
- When that specific time passes, the workflow rule reevaluates the record to make sure that it still meets the rule criteria. If the record does, the workflow rule executes those actions.
- A Time Trigger can be
	1. Before or After
	2. Specific Hours or Days of
	3. Rule Trigger Dated or Record Created Date or Record Last Modified Date.
**NOTE** : 
1. Time-dependent actions aren’t executed independently. They’re grouped into a single batch that starts executing within one hour after the first action enters the batch. Hence, real execution might be delayed.
2. To monitor the pending Queue of Workflow Actions go to Setup &rarr; Time-Based Workflow.
___
#### 6. Explain the Task Action available in Workflow Rules
- A Task is a To-Do Activity assigned to a User.
- A Task must have the following fields
	1. Assigned to
	2. Status
	3. Priority
	4. Due Date
	5. Subject
	6. Unique Name
- A Task can be assigned to 
	1. A User
	2. A Role
	3. Owner of the Record
- The Status of the Task can be
	1. Not Started
	2. In Progress
	3. Completed
	4. Waiting on Someone Else
	5. Deferred
- The Tasks Priority can be
	1. Normal
	2. High
	3. Low
- The Due date can be Plus/Minus Days from the
	1. Rule Trigger Date
	2. Record Created Date
	3. Or any Date Field on the Record ex: SLA Expiration Date on Account Record
**NOTE** :
1. Task is an Object so you can create new fields and Page Layouts for it.
2. If you create a Task directly from the Tasks Tab the you need to also select the Contact record and Related to Account Record.
____
#### 7. Explain the Email Alert Action available in Workflow Rules.
- An Email must have the following fields
	1. Email Template
	2. Recipient Type
	3. From Email Addresses
	4. Description
	5. Unique Name
- Recipient Type - Who will receive the Email
	1. A User
	2. Record Owner
	3. Record Creator
	4. Last Modified by User
	5. Role
	6. Role and Subordinates
	7. Email Field on the Record
___
#### 8. Explain the Field Update Action available in Workflow Rules.
- Field Update, updates a Fields value when the record meets the Evaluation and Rule Criteria's.
- You Need to Provide
	1. Field to Update - Select a Field that should be updated.
	2. Re-evaluate Workflow Rules after Field Change - Suppose the value that you updated is used as a Rule Criteria in some other Workflow for the Same sObject then enabling this option will trigger that Workflow Rule. This sort of Domino effect can happen up to five times.
	3. Specify New Field Value - Provide a Value for the Field
**NOTE** : 
1. Field updates occur before tasks, email alerts and outbound messages.
2. Field updates function independently of field-level security. Therefore, a workflow rule can update fields even though they’re hidden on the user's page layout.
3. You can do Cross-object Field Update i.e. a Workflow Rule on Child can update the Parents field.
4. Cross-object workflow rules aren’t candidates for reevaluation.
____
#### 9. Explain the Outbound Messages Action available in Workflow Rules.
- The Outbound Messages Sends the Info of your record to an External Site.
- You Need to Provide
	1. Endpoint URL - The URL of the Website that will receive the info.
	2. User to Send as - Ex: Send as Admin or john(user)
	3. Record Field to Send.
**NOTE** : Outbound Messages is based on SOAP API and sends HTTP POST Request to the Endpoint URL.
___
