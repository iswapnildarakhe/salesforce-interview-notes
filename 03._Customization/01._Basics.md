#### 1. What is Apex?
- Apex is a 
	1. Strongly Typed
	2. Case insensitive (ex: A == a);
	3. Object Oriented programming language.
- It is a Server Side Language which runs on Force.com platform.
___
#### 2. Difference between Strongly typed and Weakly typed Language.

| Strongly Typed     | Weakly Typed     |
|:-----|:-----|
|1. Variables must be declared with there DataTypes before they are used. <br/> 2. Variables are bound to their DataTypes and can only store data which matches their DataType. <br/> 3. Does not support Implicit Conversion i.e. you have to do manual type casting.|1. Variables can be used without prior declaration. <br/> 2. Any type of value can be stored in them. <br/> 3. Supports Implicit Conversion.|

#### 3. What is a Data Type? What are the Data Types supported in Apex?
- Data types in programming defines the kind of data that can be stored and manipulated by a variable. So, a Data type tells the Form, Size and Behavior of the Value stored in a Variable. 
- Apex has 2 Types of Data Types : Primitive and Non-Primitive.
1. Primitive Data Types:
	1. Boolean
	2. Integer
	3. Long
	4. Decimal
	5. Double
	6. Id
	7. String
	8. Date
	9. Time	10. Date Time
	11. Blob
2. Non-Primitive Data Types:
	1. Collections
	2. Classes
	3. sObjects
	4. Interfaces
	5. Enums
____
#### 4. In how many ways can you Invoke Apex?
We invoke Apex in the following ways:
1. Executing Synchronously
	1. Execute Anonymous Window
	2. Trigger
2. Executing Asynchronously
	1. Future Methods
	2. Queueable Apex
	3. Batch Apex
	4. Scheduled Apex
3. Other ways
	1. Exposing Apex Methods as SOAP Web Services
	2. Exposing Apex Classes as REST Web Services
	3. Visualforce Classes
	4. Lightning Web Components

#### 5. What is the Difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous Apex?

|Synchronous|Asynchronous|
|---|---|
|1. Synchronous means occuring or existing at the Same Time.  <br>2. Synchronous Apex means entire Apex code is executed in one single go.|1. Asynchronous means not occuring or not existing at the Same Time.  <br>2. Asynchronous apex is executed when resources are available. So any calling method which calls Asynchronous apex won't wait for outcome of Asynchronous call. Calling method will go on further execution in code. And Asynchronous execution happens in separate thread and then it will return to main program.|

____
#### 6. When should you prefer Synchronous or Asynchronous Apex invocation?
Use
1. Synchronous Apex
	1. If you want the response to be quick ex: While use is interacting with a lwc or VF-Page.
	2. If your operation is within the Synchronous Apex Governor Limits.
2. Asynchronous Apex
	1. If your operation is a long running operation ex: Changing Field values of lot's of records using Batch Class.
	2. When you want to schedule the Apex.
	3. If your operation need more resources than that of Synchronous Apex Governor Limits.
