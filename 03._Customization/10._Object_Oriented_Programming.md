#### 1. What is Object Oriented Programming?
- Object-oriented programming is a way of writing code where we focus on creating Objects, which are like building blocks that represent things or ideas in the real world.
- The Class is the Blue Print it has the Properties(Variables) and Behavior(Methods). Objects are created from the Classes.
- Examples of OOP Languages : Java, JavaScript, Apex. 
- There are 4 Principles of OOP:
	1. Abstraction
	2. Encapsulation
	3. Polymorphism
	4. Inheritance

___
#### 4. What is Polymorphism and give its example in Apex.
- Polymorphism means of different forms.
- In Apex we can see Polymorphism in 
	1. **Implementing Interface** : While we Implement an Interface we have to Implement its methods so, the same method is Implemented differently by different Classes.
	2. **Method Overriding** : When we override a Method we are having a different Implementation hence, 2 methods have same name but different Implementation.

#### 5. What is Inheritance and give its example in Apex.
Inheritance in Apex can be seen while Extending a Class.
While a Class `extends` another `virtual` or `abstract` Class it Inherits all the Properties and Behaviors from that Class.
