#### 1. What is the return type of a SOQL?
- The Return type of a SOQL depends on the keywords that you used in a SOQL
- Mainly a SOQL can Return
	1. List of sObjects (i.e. records)
	2. Integer
	3. sObject
	4. Array `AggregateResult[]`
```apex
public class Demo {
    public static void soqlReturnsList(){
        List<Account> accList = [SELECT Id FROM Account LIMIT 10];
        System.debug(accList.size());
    }
    
    public static void soqlReturnsObject(){
        sObject accRecord1 = [SELECT Id FROM Account LIMIT 1];
        Account accRecord2 = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Id = '0012w00001TkCAYAA3'];
        System.debug(accRecord1);
        System.debug(accRecord2);
    }
    
    public static void soqlReturnsInteger(){
        Integer recordCount = [SELECT COUNT() FROM Account];
        System.debug(recordCount);
    }
    
    public static void soqlReturnsArray(){
        AggregateResult[] groupedResults
            = [SELECT CampaignId, AVG(Amount)
               FROM Opportunity
               GROUP BY CampaignId];
        for (AggregateResult ar : groupedResults)  {
            System.debug('Campaign ID' + ar.get('CampaignId')+'Average amount' + ar.get('expr0'));
        }
    }
}
```

#### 2. How to Store a SOQL in Set or Map?
Just write the SOQL in the Bracket `()` while declaring the Set or Map
```apex
Set<Account> accSet = new Set<Account>([SELECT Id, Name, Rating FROM Account]);

Map<Id, Account> accMap = new Map<Id, Account>([SELECT Id, Name, Rating FROM Account]);
```
___
### using for each loop to access data
```apex
// Itterating List or Set
List<String> studentName = new List<String>{'John', 'Mark', 'Henry'};
    for(String student : studentName){ // Fetches one record at a time
        System.debug('Name = '+student);
    }

// Itterating Map and accessing both key and values
Map<Integer, String> studentMap = new Map<Integer, String>{20 =>'John', 25 =>'Mark', 69 =>'Hery'};
    for(Integer rollNumber : studentMap.keySet()){
        System.debug('roll number = '+rollNumber+' and Name = '+studentMap.get(rollNumber));
    }
```
___
#### 3. What is a Binding Variable in SOQL
- We pass value in the `WHERE` clause in the SOQL to refine our SOQL so, that it only returns records that we want. ex: `SELECT Id, Gender__c FROM Candidate__c WHERE Gender__c = 'MALE'`
- But instead of Passing the value directly if we want to use a Variable or Collection as Value then we reference that Variable or Collection in our SOQL and this reference is called as Binding Variable.

When to use `IN :` ,`=`,`=:`
1. Use `=` to give direct values
```apex
public class BindingVariables {
    Static List<Account> accList = new List<Account>();
    public Static void displayAccountInfo(){
        for(Account acc : [SELECT Id, Name, Phone FROM Account WHERE Id ='0012w00001CebxdAAB']){
            accList.add(acc);
        }
        System.debug(accList.size());
    }
}
```
2. Use `=:` to access value from a variable
```apex
public class BindingVariables {
    static Id accId ='0012w00001CebxdAAB';
    
    static List<Account> accList = new List<Account>();
    public static void displayAccountInfo(){
        for(Account acc : [SELECT Id, Name, Phone FROM Account WHERE Id =:accId]){
            accList.add(acc);
        }
        System.debug(accList.size());
    }
}
```
3. Use `IN :` to access value from a List or Set or `Map.keySet()` or `Map.values()`.
```apex
public class BindingVariables {
    static List<String> nameList = new List<String>{'GenePoint', 'United Oil & Gas, UK', 'United Oil & Gas, Singapore', 'Edge Communications'};
    static List<Account> accList = new List<Account>();
    public static void displayAccountInfo(){
        for(Account acc : [SELECT Id, Name, Phone FROM Account WHERE Name IN : nameList]){
            accList.add(acc);
        }
        System.debug(nameList.size() == accList.size());
    }
}
```

#### 4. How to fetch Deleted Records in SOQL
- On every Object there is a Field `isDeleted` which is set to true as soon as the record is Deleted and is in the Recycle Bin.
- So, we write `isDeleted =true` after `WHERE` and append `ALL ROWS`
```apex
public class Demo1 {
    static List<Account> accList =[SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Name LIKE 'Demo%' AND isDeleted=true ALL ROWS];
    public static void display(){
        for(Account acc : accList){
            System.debug(acc.Name);
        }
        System.debug(accList.size());
    }
}
```
if you don't write `isDeleted =true` then all the records i.e. `database + recycleBin` will be fetched.
___
### Relationship Queries
If you want to fetch Records from 2 different object using 1 SOQL it's Mandatory to have a Relationship between them.
#### 5. How do we write a Parent to Child SOQL
- We write Inner Query for the Child sObject which is related to Parent sObject. Hence, to fetch the Inner Object records we will write a nested for Loop.
- In the inner Query we don't write the sObject name of Parent after the `FROM` keyword instead we need to Write the Child Relationship Name.
Ex: For each Account the nested for loop will run for the Contacts it has.
```apex
public class RelationshipQueries {
    public void parentToChild(){
        List<Account> accList = new List<Account>();
        accList = [SELECT Id, Name , (SELECT Id, lastName, Phone FROM Contacts) FROM Account WHERE Id IN (SELECT AccountID FROM Contact)]; /* I used the SOQL on Contact in WHERE clause so that only such Accounts will be fetched that has atleast 1 Contact */
        
        for(Account acc : accList){
            System.debug('Account Name = '+acc.Name);
            for(Contact con : acc.Contacts){	// This is how you access the inner query
                System.debug('Contact Name ='+con.lastName);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
**Limitations of Parent to Child SOQL:**
- No more than 20 parent-to-child relationships can be specified in a query i.e. You can have 20 nested sub-queries. ex: Account is Parent of Opportunity and Contact so you can have 1 inner query for each. i.e. you can fetch 20 Child objects for 1 Parent Object in 1 query.
- Aggregate functions, such as SUM(), COUNT(), and MAX(), cannot be used in Parent-to-Child SOQL queries.
-  **You cannot have a inner query inside a inner query** i.e. Parent to child supports only 1 level deep query.
____
#### 6. How to get the Child Relationship name for the Parent to Child inner Query
- To get the relationship name : Object Manager → Child sObject → Fields and Relationships → Find a Field under DataType which is MDR or Lookup ex: Lookup(Account) Click on that field → Copy Child Relationship Name.
- Process is same for both Standard and Custom fields only difference is that if the Child Object is a Custom then you need to append `__r` in the Child Relationship Name.
```soql
SELECT Id, Name, (SELECT Name, Amount, StageName FROM Opportunities) FROM Account

SELECT Id, First_Name__c, Gender__c, (SELECT Id, City__c FROM addresses__r
) FROM Applicant__c
```
**NOTE** :
- You get Relationship Name from Child Object because you always create a Relationship field on a Child Object.
- Generally the Relationship Name for Parent to Child traverse is just the Plural name of the Child Object's API name. (Hence, whenever you create a Custom Object always write the API name as Singular the Tab Name can be and technically should be Plural as the Tab holds multiple Records for that Object)
____
#### 7. How do we write a Child to Parent SOQL
- The Relationship Name for the Child to Parent is the API Name of the Relationship Field . 
- **Process** : Setup &rarr; Object Manager &rarr; Select the Child Object &rarr; Select the Relationship Fields Name and if this a Custom Relationship Field then Append `__r`.
- You can directly Write the Parent name and use a dot to access its Fields ex: `Account.Name`
```apex
public class RelationshipQueries {
    public void childToParentStandardRelationship(){ // the relationship was created by salesforce
        List<Contact> conList = new List<Contact>();
        conList = [SELECT Id, lastName, Account.Name FROM Contact LIMIT 25];
        
        for(Contact con : conList){
            System.debug('Contact Name = '+con.lastName+' Account Name = '+con.Account.Name); // This is how you access the Parent fields
        }
    }

    public void childToParentCustomRelationship(){ // the relationship was created by you
    	List<Child_Object__c> childList = [SELECT Id, Child_Object__c.Parent__r.Id, Child_Object__c.Parent__r.Name__c FROM Child_Object__c];
        for(Child_Object__c rec : childList){
            System.debug('Child Id'+rec.Id+' Parent Name'+rec.Parent__r.Name__c);
        }
    }
}
```
**Limitations of Child to Parent SOQL :
- Child to Parent support up-to 5 level deep query. (A Child must be having a Parent that Parent might be a Child of some Other Parent and so on). For example, `Contact.Account.Owner.FirstName` (three levels).
- No more than 55 child-to-parent relationships can be specified in a query. A custom object allows up to 40 relationships, so you can reference all the child-to-parent relationships for a custom object in one query.
___
#### 8. Can you write both Parent to Child and Child to Parent relationship query in a Single SOQL
- Yes, so first you need such sObject which has 
	1. A Parent
	2. A Child

```apex
public class Demo {
    public static void together(){
        // This SOQL only fetches such Contacts that has both Parent Account and a Child Case
        List<Contact> conList = [SELECT ID, Name, Account.Name, AccountId, Account.Rating,(SELECT ContactId, CaseNumber, Subject FROM 
                                                                                           Cases) FROM Contact WHERE AccountId != null AND Id IN (SELECT ContactId FROM Case)];
        
        for(Contact conRec : conList){
            System.debug('Parent Name ='+conRec.Account.Name+' current record name ='+conRec.Name);
            for(Case caseRec : conRec.Cases){
                System.debug('Case Number ='+ caseRec);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### 9. When to Use SOQL
1. when you know which objects the data resides in
2. Retrieve data from a single object or from multiple objects that are related to one another.
3. Count the number of records that meet specified criteria.
4. Sort results as part of the query.
___
#### 10. How to fetch Multi-Select Picklist Field such that it contains certain Values
As we know a Multi-Select Picklist Field has multiple values so the condition in WHERE clause is different
```sql
SELECT Gender__c FROM Candidate__c WHERE Gender__c includes ('Other;Male','Female')
/* Here the SOQL will fetch such Candidate Records where the Gender field has
1. Both Other and Male Selected
2. Only Female is Selected
*/
```
- `includes` - only show records that have the given Multiselect Picklist values
- `excludes` - only show records that don't have the given Multiselect Picklist values
- `=` - `Gender__c = 'Other;Male'` to pass 1 Set of values. Here if you use `!=` those records will be fetch that does not have the provided values.

### Complex SOQLs
Till now we saw how to write SOQL on 2 Objects that are Related to Each Other. But things get complex as more Objects come into play.
