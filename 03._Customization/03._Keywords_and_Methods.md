#### 1. What is a Class?
- In Object Oriented Programming a Class is a Blueprint for Objects.
- A Class encapsulates the Class Members which defines what an Object can do.
___
#### 2. What is an Instance of a Class.
- An Instance of a Class is just an Object that we created.
- Anything that's not declared as `static` will be Instance Member.
___
#### 3. What do you mean by Class Members?
- Variables and Methods declared inside a Class are Called Class Members.
- Class Members are of 2 types
	1. Static : Variables and Methods that are declared `static`.
	2. Non-Static : Any Variable and Method that's not `static`.
___ 
#### 4. How do we access the Members defined in a Class.
We access Class Members via 2 Methods:
1. **By Creating an Instance** : We access Non-Static Class Members by creating an Instance.
2. **By Class Name** :  We access Static Class Members by the Class Name
___
#### 5. Explain `static` keyword.
- When we declare a Class Member as `static` then its associated with the Class itself i.e. we can only access it by using the Class Name.
- The values of a `static` keyword will be same for all the Instances created from that Class.
**NOTE** : 
1. You cannot access a Non-Static Member inside a Static Method.
2. But you can access a Static Member inside a Non-Static Method.
3. You cannot use Static in Inner Classes it can only be used in Top Level Class.
___
#### 4. Explain class member vs local member OR What is the Difference between Class Scope and Local Scope?

| Class Member     | Local Member     |
|:-----|:-----|
| - Class Members are Variable that are declared at the Class Level i.e. outside of any other code block but within the Classes Block. <br/> - A Class member can be static or instance variable. <br/> - A Class Variable can be accessed from anywhere inside a Class or a Class that extends this class i.e. the scope of a Class Member is Wide.| - A Local Member is a Variable which declared inside a Code block ex: a Method is a Code Block. <br/> - The Local Member can only be accessed from withing the Code Block and ceases to exist outside of the code block. <br/> - The Local Variables are only created for temporary storage only for ex: We use Integer i for Normal for loops      |


___
#### 5. Explain `this` keyword
- We know that is a Class Scope and a Local Scope.
- If there are 2 Variable with the same name 1 as a Class Member and other is Local Member. Here, if we want to access the Instance Variable inside the Code block then we use `this` keyword to specify that we want the Instance Variable and not the Local Variable.
___
####  6. What is a Variable?
- A Variable is a Named Storage in programming which holds a Value that's assigned to it.
- There are certain Characteristics of a Variable
	1. Declaration : Variable must be declared before its used.
	2. Data Type  : A Variable in Apex must have a Data Type.
	2. Static or Instance : A Variable can be Static or Instance Variable.
	4. Class or Local Variable : A Variable can have a Class or Local Scope.
___
#### 7. Declaration vs Initialization

|  Declaration    |   Initialization   |
|:-----|:-----|
| Declaration is when you Declare a Variable for the 1st time.      |  Initialization is when you assign a value to the Variable at the time of Declaration    |
___
#### 8. Explain `final` keyword.
- We use `final` keyword when we want to make a Variable Constant.
- A Constant Variable is a Variable whose value cannot be changed after the Initialization.
- As we know that all Variables are Initialized to `null` in Apex, the Constants will also be Initialized to `null` and hence, you won't be able to Assign a Different value to it.
- There are 2 ways to Assign a value to a Un-Initialized Constant Variable is
	1. Static Code Block i.e. Initialization Code Block.
	2. Custom Constructor.
___
#### 9. What is a Method?
- A Method is a code block that performs certain Operations.
- A Method defines what behavior or actions the Instance of that Class can Perform.
- It is mandatory that a Method must have a return type. A method can return
	1. `void` : It means that the method does not return a value.
	2. Any other Data Type : It means the method returns a value of this Data Type.
- If a method is returning a Value then its mandatory that the last statement of the code block must be a `return` statement that returns a value of the same Data Type as of the return type.
- A Method can be Parameterized or Non-Parameterized.
**NOTE** : All methods must be named uniquely and if similar names are used then the Signature must be different.
___
#### 10. How to ensure that 2 methods have different signatures?
These rules apply when the method names are same.
1. The methods must not accept same number of Parameters.
2. If they accept the same number of Parameters then there Data Types must be different.
3. If the Number of Parameters and Data Types are both same then the Order of Parameters must be different.
----
#### 11. Differentiate between Parameterized and Non-Parameterized Methods.

|  Non-Parameterized    |  Parameterized    |
|:-----|:-----|
| Does not accept any arguments.| It accepts certain arguments and then acts accordingly.|
____

#### 12. What is a return type of a Method?
A return type means which type of value can a method return in it's return statement.
____
#### 13. What are Constructors?
- A Constructor is a Special block of Code which is invoked while creating an Instance of the Class using `new` keyword.
- A Constructor can be Non-Parameterized or Parameterized.
- A Constructor is used to do some initial setup tasks for ex: a Custom Constructor can be used to Change the Value of a Constant for the specific instance.
- In a Apex Class even if you don't create a Constructor there is an already present Default Non-Parameterized Constructor.
- There are certain characteristics of a Constructor.
	1. The Name of a Constructor is Similar to that of the Class.
	2. A Constructor does not have a return type or a return statement.
	3. Constructor cannot be `static`.
	4. A Constructor cannot be Private or Protected.
____
#### 14. What is Object Oriented Programming?
- Object-oriented programming is a way of writing code that focuses on creating objects, which are like building blocks that represent things or ideas in the real world.
- These objects have Properties and Behavior that define their characteristics and what they can do
- There are some Principles of OOP:
	1. Abstraction
	2. Encapsulation
	3. Inheritance
	4. Polymorphism
___
#### 15. What is Abstraction and give its example in Apex.
___
#### 16. What is Encapsulation and give its example in Apex.
____
#### 17. What is Inheritance and give its example in Apex.
____
#### 18. What is Polymorphism and give its example in Apex.
____
#### 19. What are Access Modifiers and which can be used where?
____
